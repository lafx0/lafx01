**Level Goal**

The password for the next level is stored in **/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14** and can only be read by **user bandit14**. For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a **private SSH key** that can be used to log into the next level.

Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on.

## Solution ##

**Short Lesson**

> **Secure Shell (SSH)** is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.[1] Typical applications include remote command-line, login, and remote command execution, but any network service can be secured with SSH.

> Public key authentication is more secure than password authentication.
With public key authentication, the authenticating entity has a **public key** and a **private key**. Each key is a large number with special mathematical properties. The private key is kept on the computer you log in from, while the public key is stored on the **.ssh/authorized_keys** file on all the computers you want to log in to. When you log in to a computer, the SSH server uses the public key to "lock" messages in a way that can only be "unlocked" by your private key - this means that even the most resourceful attacker can't snoop on, or interfere with, your session. As an extra security measure, most SSH programs store the private key in a passphrase-protected format, so that if your computer is stolen or broken in to, you should have enough time to disable your old public key before they break the passphrase and start using your key.

The goal of this level is to connect via **SSH** to the next level, were we will be able to read the password.  

We have a private key under the working directory:

In order to connect to the next level, we will use the ssh command with the following switches:

- `-i` to specify the identity file (the private key)
- `localhost` as the name of the machine to connect to
- `-l bandit14` to specify the user we want to impersonate during the connection

{{< highlight bash >}}
bandit13@bandit:~$ ssh -i sshkey.private localhost -l bandit14
{{< /highlight >}}

Now that we are connected as the bandit14 user, we can easily read the password stored in **/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14** as we have the permission to do so:

{{< highlight bash >}}
bandit14@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e
{{< /highlight >}}

&nbsp;

We successfully found the password for **Level 14** !
